.SH NAME
.B _printf
- simple formatted output function

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.br
.B int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf
prints text to the standard output (usually the terminal) using a
format string and a list of extra arguments.
The format string can contain normal characters, which are printed as they are,
and format specifiers that start with '%' and are replaced by values.

.SH SUPPORTED FORMAT SPECIFIERS
.B %c
- Print a single character. The next argument is taken as an int and printed as a char.
.br
.B %s
- Print a string. The next argument is taken as a char * and printed until the '\0' byte.
If the pointer is NULL, the text "(null)" is printed.
.br
.B %%
- Print a single '%' character. No extra argument is used.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.B _printf
returns the number of characters written to the output.
If the format string is NULL or an error occurs, it returns -1.

.SH NOTES
This implementation is a project version of the standard C
.B printf
function. It only supports the format specifiers listed above, and does
not handle flags, width, precision, or length modifiers.
